# devops_test
Prerequisites:
1. A CloudFormation template has been created, featuring an EC2 instance configured with an attached ELB. To ensure the template functions correctly, a VPC and subnet must be configured. Additionally, since JSON is data-only, it is recommended to remove the "_comment" sections from the code.
2. A Python script has been developed to fetch data from an API link. To execute the script, the required module should be installed using the command pip install module.
